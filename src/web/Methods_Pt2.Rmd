## *Data Representation*
### Word Embeddings
To determine the similarity between the documents word embeddings was used.The word embedding techniques are used to represent words mathematically. Word Embeddings are a method of extracting features out of text so that we can input those features into a machine learning model to work with text data. They try to preserve syntactical and semantic information. It is an approach for representing words and documents. Word Embedding or Word Vector is a numeric vector input that represents a word in a lower-dimensional space. It allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. 

## *Hugging Face*
Hugging face is an open source AI platform where we can create, build, and train models for open source collaboration. Hugging Face's Transformer library lets you connect to these models, send tasks, and receive outputs without having to set them up yourself. You can also download models, train them with your own data, or quickly create a Space. This makes it easy to find models to complete any kind of task, connect them with your own code, and start getting results. We have used the below two hugging face models.
