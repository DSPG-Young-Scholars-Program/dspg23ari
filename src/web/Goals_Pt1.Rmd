#### The goal of the first part of the project was to use Army documents to create a dataset of officer assignments that could assist the Social and Decision Analytics Division (SDAD) and other Army analysts in modeling soldier career progression. 

<br>

- **Assignments** are jobs, or positions, a soldier can hold in their branch of the Army.
- Assignments occur with a **Rank**, such as "Captain" or "Colonel." 
- Assignments are also categorized as either **Key Developmental** or **Developmental/Broadening** 
    - "Key Developmental" assignments are the most important assignments for an officer to complete in order to advance in rank.

#### The task of extracting a simple dataset from complex source material prompted us to explore a variety of methods for extracting data from a corpus of documents with inconsistent information presentation and formatting.
